/* Identify the Constructors for each of the following methods and classify each method as either a "Static" or a "Prototype" method:

substring
  - Constructor: String
  - Method Type: Prototype
create
  - Constructor: Object
  - Method Type: Static
fromCharCode
  - Constructor: String
  - Method Type: Static
slice
  - Constructor: Array, String
  - Method Type: Prototype
toString
  - Constructor: Object, Array, Number, String
  - Method Type: Prototype

It might be that more than one constructor provides a method with a given name. Make sure you list them all in your answer. You can limit your search for methods to the String, Object, Array, and Number constructors.
