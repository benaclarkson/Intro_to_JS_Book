// Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:

let foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
console.log(foo.length);  // => 3
console.log(foo[3]);      // will this result in an error?

// The following code will not result in an error, but will log `3` and `undefined` to the console.
