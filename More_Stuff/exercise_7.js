// What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

/* Solution
// Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and
// predictable manner.
// Most of the time, JavaScript fails silently. Exception handling is helpful
// when JS doesn't fail silently and you want to do something with the 
// information presented after a failure.
